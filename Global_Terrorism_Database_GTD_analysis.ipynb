        "The Data set on the Global terrorism database was the first choice of both of us. There are two people Shashank and I (Anshu) in the team. The data was relevant in the sense that as soon as we saw the columns we could visualize the questions that needed to be answered. As this terrorism agenda is always in the news both nationally and internationally, there was no hesitation whatsoever and we were pretty comfortable and sure with our choice of project. Both of us were equally fascinated by the nature  of attack and the type of attack, as both love spy thrillers. The dataset was pretty simple and contained some null values that had to be filtered out.  \n",
        "The dataset contained 181691 rows and 135 columns. Out of these 17 columns were selected, based on the requirements of the questions to be answered. There was no duplicated data present in these 17 columns.\n",
        "From the filtered dataset we had to frame the questions and answer those questions based on the finding from the dataset. The questions that we choose started from the general questions pertaining to global data and then narrowing down to the specific most terror prone region. The insights from these regions were taken up that can be helpful for the security agencies in planning risk and crisis management. We began with the first general graph that plots the world wise year wise attack that gave us a broad overview of the region wise and year wise attack. The next question pertained to the top ten regions considering the terror attacks. Then we picked up questions such as the most frequent type of attack , the most common weapon used in the attack. Which terror group was most active during this time was the next question. Then we shifted our focus to various countries from different regions which are attacked the most in this period. We then shifted our focus to the two nations from the two regions that were targeted frequently by the terror groups. From the Middle East and Northern Africa region, Iraq was chosen and from South Asian region Pakistan was chosen. And further data exploration was done on them.\n"

        "**The global issue of terrorism has seen a significant shift in the attack pattern. With the advancement in technology and weaponry, there has been a paradigm shift in the way terror groups have planned attacks and weapons of attack. What if we wanted to know the recent trends in the nature of attack, as the type of weapon and the common targets of these groups? What are the major terrorist groups in a particular region? Which terror group has been most deadly in recent years and what are its modus operandi for the attacks? The global terrorism database provides us with data that records terror activities from the year and various other aspects such as the region, the year of the attack, the nature of the attack, the type of weapon used, the country affected, the group that claimed the attack, the type of target, and the total fatalities in the attack and many more. Explore and analyze data to discover key findings pertaining to terrorist activities to Improve understanding and mitigation of terrorism trends and patterns.\n",
